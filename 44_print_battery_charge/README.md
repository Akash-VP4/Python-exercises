Write a function named battery_charge that graphically represents a batteryâ€™s charge. Your function doesn't need to return anything, but just show how much a battery is charged.

This function will takes an int between 0 and 100 as a parameter, display a bar to represent how much the battery is "filled" (from 0 to 10 bars), then prints the percentage.
