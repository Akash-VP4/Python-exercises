Take number 31 and its reverse 13, then look at the squares of these two numbers: 961 and 169. You can see that the squares are also reverses of each other.

An Adam number is a number that verifies this property: its square is the reverse of the square of its reverse.

Write the function check_adam_number(num) which takes an integer num and returns True if this number is an Adam number, otherwise False.
