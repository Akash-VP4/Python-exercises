Write a function named find_consecutive_sum that takes an integer n and returns a triplet of consecutive integers (a, b, c) such that a + b + c == n.

In case no such triplet exists, your function should return None.

Examples

>>> find_consecutive_sum(15)
(4, 5, 6)

>>> find_consecutive_sum(10)
None
