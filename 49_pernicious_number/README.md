The program will print the pernicious numbers in the range(222281, 222381)

This exercises may be hard if you don't understand what a pernicious number is, and is not mandatory to continue, so you can skip it.

One number per line, nothing else.

If the exercice were to be in the range(100, 110) should print:


$ ./solution.py
100
103
104
107
109
